## Dependencies and data

The Python dependencies (mjlab, MuJoCo, MuJoCo Warp, NVIDIA Warp, PyTorch, matplotlib, Pillow) are installed from
their own distributions under their own licenses (Apache-2.0, BSD-3-Clause and others) and are not redistributed here.
Motion data are not redistributed. The LAFAN1 motions (Ubisoft La Forge, CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) and the Unitree G1
description (BSD-3-Clause) are downloaded by `tools/download_data.sh`; files derived from motion data (the videos in
`docs/static/videos`, checkpoints) are not covered by this repository's MIT License.

## EVT integration

The EVT control values in `assets/evt/config.json` come from the user's local allmimic checkout, branch `armature`,
commit `e17f339` (`DEX_EVT_CFG`). `tools/prepare_evt.py` imports its `assets/robots/evt/urdf/evt2_simple.xml` and
STL meshes into the git-ignored `data/evt/` directory and records source hashes. These third-party robot assets
are not redistributed here, and this repository does not assign them a new license. The EVT LAFAN1 motion archive
is read from its existing location; the LAFAN1 data terms above still apply.
